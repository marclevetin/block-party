## ðŸš€ Bedford Block Party

Our neighborhood throws a block party every September. I needed to learn Gatsby, since it was listed as one of the preferred frameworks on React.dev, and was looking for an excuse to poke at Tailwind and Typescript a bit.

See it live: https://bedfordblock.party/

To see the code

1.  `git clone` the repo to your machine
2.  `cd` into the folder and open the code in your favorite IDE
3.  Run `npm run develop`.
4.  The site should open at http://localhost:8000
